# League Companion App

This project's purpose is for me to learn Typescript, React, electron and other front end tools/frameworks. I plan to add features that I believe other programs/sites would benefit from, however due to the requirement of an external server to access riot api's there is no planned release of this.

### Inspiration

I recently began using [We will teach you League](https://weteachleague.com/)'s auto recording program, and have found a few ways in which I believe it could be inproved.

### Planned Features

- [ ] Auto recording league of legends games
- [ ] Easy way to look through VODs to find games
- [ ] Note taking features
- [ ] Mark which champions a given note is relavent for
- [ ] Bring previously taken notes to the forefront when the relavent champions are in the current game
