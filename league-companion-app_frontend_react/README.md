# league-companion-app_frontend_react

This is the main UI code for the companion app. This gets information from the electron window about the currently logged in user and uses that information to make calls to the riot api through the go proxy server. (The go "proxy" server exists because it is against TOS and bad practice to serve the RIOT_API_KEY to the end user of a product.)
